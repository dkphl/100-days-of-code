# I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge
## Start Date
### August 20th, 2018
## Main Commitment
### *Work on coding projects ~~for at least an hour~~ every day for the next 100 days.*
## Additional Rules
1. I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
2. I will update the [log](log.md) with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
3. I will work on real projects, facing real challenges. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge.
